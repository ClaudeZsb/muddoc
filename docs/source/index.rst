Welcome to Muddoc!
===================================

**Muddoc** is a documentation of `mud <https://mud.dev/>`_ written by mud developers and focg buidlers,
especially for native `solidity <https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/>`_ developers. We think that `mud's official documentation <https://mud.dev/introduction>`_
is not particularly friendly to native solidity developers, so we decided to write this documentation.

Check out the :doc:`/basics/001_introduction_to_mud_framework` section for an introduction and examples of mud, including
how to :ref:`installation` the mud.

.. note::

   This documentation temporarily only focuses on the smart contract written part of the mud project.
